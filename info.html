    <header id="info">About Me</header>
    <p id="p_info">Hi , I`m Azizjon Atamuradov. I moved to the United States last year and I have 15 years of work experience  in different fields.  <br>
        During my career , I gained many skills, including communication,
        problem - solving, teamwork and adaptability. <br>
        I recently graduated from the Per Scholas IT Bootcamp , where I learned HTML, CSS, JavaScript and frameworks like React and Node.js. <br>
        I chose IT, specifically software engineering  because everything is related to IT and I believe technology can make a real difference in how we live and work. <br>
        My goal is to create solutions that help people in their daily lives by building software  that makes everyday tasks easier and improves people's lives. <br>
        I know I have some experience in IT, but I am focused on learning and working on myself to get better in this area. <br>
        I am confident that skills I have can help your company continue to grow and achieve effective results.
        Life gives us many chances but not everyone uses them.  <br> 
        I see this as my chance to join your team and I am eager to make the most of it.
